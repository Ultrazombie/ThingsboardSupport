# ThingsboardSupport

Here are our best practices to help solve service support needs.

We have scripts:
- databases - for database backup and restore (Casandra, Postgres, Postgres + Timescale)
- logs - for parsing the logs to find out the average and maximum number of messages in the queues
- telemetry - to test sending telemetry to test devices
